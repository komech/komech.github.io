%% Abstract in English:

The so-called damped Navier--Stokes equations in the whole 2D space:
%$$
\begin{equation*}
\begin{cases}
{\partial_t}u+(u,{\nabla_x})u={\Delta_x} u-\alpha u+{\nabla_x} p+g,\\ {\operatorname{div}}
u=0,\ \
u\big|_{t=0}=u_0,
\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
%$$
where $\alpha$ is a positive parameter, will be considered and the results on
the global well-posedness, dissipativity and further regularity of weak solutions of this problem
in the uniformly-local spaces $L^2_b(\R^2)$ will be presented. These results are obtained 
based on the further development of the weighted
energy theory for the Navier--Stokes type problems. Note that any divergent free vector field
$u_0\in L^\infty(\mathbb R^2)$ is allowed and no assumptions on the spatial decay of solutions as $|x|\to\infty$ are
posed.
\par
In addition, the applications to the classical Navier--Stokes
problem in $\mathbb R^2$ (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$) will be also considered. In particular, the improved estimate on the possible growth rate of spatially non-decaying solutions as time goes to infinity:
$$
\|u(t)\|_{L^2_b(\R^2)}\le C(t^5+1),
$$ 
where $C$ depends on $u_0$ and $g$, but is independent of $t$, will be presented. Note that the previous best known estimate was super-exponential in time:
$$
\|u(t)\|_{L^\infty(\R^2)}\le C_1e^{C_2 t^2},
$$
