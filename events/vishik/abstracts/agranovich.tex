We discuss some fundamental facts of the theory of strongly elliptic
second-order systems in bounded Lipschitz domains. We propose a simplified
choice of the right-hand side of the system and the conormal derivative in the
Green formula. Using ``Weyl's decomposition'' of the space of solutions, we
obtain two-sided estimates for solutions of the Dirichlet and Neumann problems.
We remove the algebraic restriction in the generalized Savar\'e theorem on the
regularity of solutions of these problems for systems with Hermitian principal
part. The corollaries for potential type operators and Poincar\'e--Steklov
operators on the boundary are strengthened. We consider the transmission
problems for two systems in domains with common Lipschitz boundary without
assumption of the absence of jumps in the coefficients on this boundary. We
construct examples of strongly elliptic second-order systems, for which the
Neumann problem does not have the Fredholm property.
