%% Abstract in English:

Let $\Omega(t)$ , $0\leq t\leq 1$, be a smooth family of bounded Euclidean domains, and let $\Delta(t)$ be the Dirichlet Laplacian in $\Omega(t)$. We call a family spectrally simple
if the spectrum of $\Delta(t)$ is simple for all $t$. We prove that spectrally simple
families form a residual set in the space of all families. A similar result holds in other situations, e.g. Laplace--Beltrami operators that correspond to a family of Riemannian metrics on a manifold, a family of Schr\"odinger operators (the potential depends on $t$).
