%% Abstract in English:
We address the problem of reconstruction of a function on a manifold
from data of its integrals over a family of hypersurfaces. The
archetypes are reconstruction of a function on a sphere from data of big
circle integrals  (Minkowski-Funk) and of a function in plane from
data of line integrals (Radon).
A general integral formula will be presented that covers all known
cases where such an explicit reconstruction is known and also several
unknown cases. Possibility of the uniform reconstruction method
depends on vanishing of some singular integrals over a sphere.
