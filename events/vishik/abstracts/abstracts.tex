{\Large\bf Remarks on strongly elliptic systems in Lipschitz domains}

\medskip

We discuss some fundamental facts of the theory of strongly elliptic
second-order systems in bounded Lipschitz domains. We propose a simplified
choice of the right-hand side of the system and the conormal derivative in the
Green formula. Using ``Weyl's decomposition'' of the space of solutions, we
obtain two-sided estimates for solutions of the Dirichlet and Neumann problems.
We remove the algebraic restriction in the generalized Savar\'e theorem on the
regularity of solutions of these problems for systems with Hermitian principal
part. The corollaries for potential type operators and Poincar\'e--Steklov
operators on the boundary are strengthened. We consider the transmission
problems for two systems in domains with common Lipschitz boundary without
assumption of the absence of jumps in the coefficients on this boundary. We
construct examples of strongly elliptic second-order systems, for which the
Neumann problem does not have the Fredholm property.

%% Abstract in English:
We generalize the elliptic Harnack
inequality proved in \cite{F}.
Additionally we relax the assumptions
of \cite{F}: the integral term measure
in it is absolutely continuous with
respect to the Lebesgue measure. The
proof exploits the basic construction
of Krylov-Safonov for elliptic
operators and its modernization for the
purpose of adding integral terms by R.
Bass.

Let $B(x,r)$ denote $\{y\in \mathbb
R^d:\,|y-x|< r\}$,\; $Q$\; be the
cylinder $\{t\in [0,2),\, |x|\in
B(0,1)\}$, and $W$ be the space of
Borel measurable bounded non-negative
functions on $\mathbb R^{d+1}$ with
restriction on $Q$ belonging to the
Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(Q)$. And let
$\mathcal L$ be an operator with Borel
measurable coefficients, acting on
$u\in W$
 according to the formula
\begin{eqnarray}%\label{def:op}
{\mathcal L}
u(t,x)&=&\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^d
a_{ij}(t,x)\frac{\partial^2u(t,x)}{\partial
x_i\partial x_j}+\sum_{i=1}^d
b_i(t,x)\frac{\partial u(t,x)}{\partial
x_i} \nonumber\\
&+&\int_{{\mathbb
R}^d\backslash\{0\}}[u(t,x+h)-u(t,x)-1_{(|h|\leq1)}h\cdot
\nabla u(t,x)]\mu(t,x;dh).\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}




ASSUMPTIONS There exist positive
constants $\lambda,K,k$ and $\beta$
such that for all $t,x$:

  1) $\lambda
|y|^2 \leq y^T a(t,x)y, \, y\in
{\mathbb R}^d;$

 2) $\|a(t,x)\|+|b(t,x)| + \int_{{\mathbb
R}^d}(|h|^2\wedge 1)\mu(t,x;dh)\leq K;$

 3)~ for any $r\in(0,1]$, $y_1,\,y_2\in
B(x,r/2)\cap B(0,1)$ and borel $A$ with
$\mathop{\mathrm {dist}}\nolimits
(x,A)\ge r$ holds $\mu(t,y_1;\{h:\,
y_1+h\in A\})\leq
kr^{-\beta}\mu(t,y_2;\{h:\, y_2+h\in
A\})$.
\begin{theorem}
There exists a positive constant
$C(d,\;\lambda,\;K,\;k,\; \beta)$ s.t.
for every $u\in W$ satisfying
\[\frac{\partial}{\partial t} + \mathcal
Lu=0 \mbox{ a.e. in }(t,x)\] holds: for
all $|x|\;\le\;\frac{1}{2}$
\[u_{0,x}\;\ge\;Cu_{1,0}.\]
\end{theorem}



The crucial point of the proof is the
extension of Prop. 3.9   \cite{F} to
the cylinder. %It bases on the
%representation of the compensator of
%the jump into a set $A$ through/by
%means $\mu(t,x_t;\{h: |x_t +h|\in
%A_t\})$.

%% Abstract in English:
Relativistic mechanics includes the relativistic dynamics of a mass point
and the relativistic field theory. In a relativistic field theory the
relativistic field dynamics is derived from a relativistic covariant
Lagrangian, such a theory allows to define the total energy and momentum,
forces and their densities but does not provide a canonical way to define
the mass, position or velocity for the system. For a closed system \emph{%
without external forces} the total momentum has a simple form $\mathbf{P}=M%
\mathbf{v}$ where $\mathbf{v}$ is a \emph{constant velocity}, allowing to
define naturally the total mass $M$ and to derive from the Lorentz
invariance Einstein's energy-mass relation $E=Mc^{2}$ with $M=m_{0}\gamma ,$
with $\gamma $ the Lorentz factor and $m_{0}$ the rest mass;
according to Einstein's formula the rest mass is determined by the internal
energy of the system.

The relativistic dynamics of a mass point is described by a relativistic
version of Newton's equation where the rest mass $m_{0}$ of a point is
prescribed; in Newtonian mechanics the mass $M$ reveals itself in \emph{%
accelerated motion} as a measure of inertia which relates the point
acceleration to the external force. The question which we address is the
following: Is it possible to construct a mathematical model where the
internal energy of a system affects its acceleration in an external force
field as the inertial mass does in Newtonian mechanics? 

We construct a model which allows to consider in the same framework the
uniform motion in the absence of external forces (a closed system) and the
accelerated motion caused by external fields; the internal energy is present
both in uniform and accelerating regimes. The model is based on the
nonlinear Klein-Gordon (KG)\ equation which is a part of our theory of
distributed charges interacting with electromagnetic (EM) fields, \cite{BF5}-%
\cite{BF8}. We prove that if a sequence of solutions of a KG\ equation
concentrates at a trajectory $\mathbf{r}(t)$ and their local energies
converge to $E(t)$ then the trajectory satisfies the relativistic version of
Newton's equation where the mass is determined in terms of the energy by
Einstein's formula, and the EM forces are determined by the coefficients of
the KG equation. We prove that the concentration assumptions hold for the
case of a general rectilinear accelerated motion.

The push forward by the Hamiltonian flow of a measure of the form:
$$\mu(x,\xi)=\rho^{\mathrm{in}}(x)\delta_{U(x)}(\xi)$$

%The considered Riemann--Hilbert problem appears when moddeling 
%the effect of magnetic field reconnection [1-4]. The statement of
%the problem is as follows. Let domain $G$ on complex plane $z = x + i y$
%be an exteriour of a system of cuts $\Gamma = \Gamma_0 \cup \Gamma^- \cup \Gamma^+$,
%where 
%$\Gamma^+ := \bigl\{z:\, z = R + r\, t\, e^{\,i \pi \alpha},\,\, t \in [0,\, 1]\bigr\}$

The Riemann--Hilbert problem is considered in a decagonal domain $G$ on complex plane,
which is an exteriour of a system $\Gamma$ of cuts $\Gamma_j$ with excluded
infinity. The sought analytic function $\mathcal{F}$ satisfies 
to the boundary condition ${\rm Re} (h\, \mathcal{F}\,) = c$\, on $\Gamma$,
where $h$ and $c$ are prescribed piece--wise constant functions;
$\mathcal{F}$ is continuous in $\overline{G} \setminus \{\infty\}$
and satisfies to a certain growth condition
at infinity. The solution $\mathcal{F}$ has been constructed in analytic form.
Asymptotics for function $\mathcal{F}$ have been found for two limit
cases of geometry of $\Gamma$; first case corresponds to $|\Gamma_j| \to \infty$,
and second case to $|\Gamma_j| \to 0$ for some numbers $j$.
The Riemann--Hilbert problem under consideration originates from magnetic 
hydrodinamics, in model \cite{S06}--\cite{BVS11} of the effect of magnetic field reconnection 
in Solar flares. The model includes a current layer and shock--waves attached to 
its end--points. The constructed solution $\mathcal{F}$ and its 
asymptotics possess clear physical meaning. For construction the asymptotics
we used an approach \cite{VMS89}, \cite{V87} and asymptotics
for Schwarz --- Christoffel integral parameters, that have been found in \cite{BV02}.

%% Abstract in English:

Consider the boundary value problem for a semilinear strongly damped wave equation in a bounded
domain~$\Omega$:
\begin{align}\label{eq_sdwe}
&u_{tt}-2\gamma\Delta u_t=\Delta u+f(u),\quad u\big|_{\partial\Omega}=0,\\
\label{un_sdwe} &u\big|_{t=0}=u_0(x)\in H_0^1(\Omega),\quad u_t\big|_{t=0}=p_0 (x)\in L_2(\Omega).
\end{align}
Here $\gamma>0$ is a coefficient of strong dissipation, and the nonlinearity $f(u)$ satisfies the
global Lipschitz condition:
$$|f(v_1)-f(v_2)|\leqslant L\,|v_1-v_2|\qquad \forall v_1, v_2 \in \R.$$

The following theorem gives sufficient condition for the existence of an inertial manifold for
equation (1).

\begin{theorem}\label{theorem}
Let $\lambda_k$, $0<\lambda_1<\lambda_2\leqslant\dots\to+\infty$, be eigenvalues of the operator
$-\Delta$ in the domain $\Omega$ under the Dirichlet boundary conditions. Suppose that there is an
N such that the following inequalities hold
$$
\lambda_N < \lambda_{N+1} < 
%AC\frac{1}{2\gamma^2}, \eqno(3)
1/(2\gamma^2), \eqno(3)
$$
$$
2L<\sup_{\gamma\lambda_N\leqslant\Phi<\gamma\lambda_{N+1}}\{(\gamma\lambda_{N+1}-\Phi)
\min\{\varkappa_1(\Phi),\varkappa_N(\Phi),\varkappa_{N+1}(\gamma\lambda_{N+1})\}\}, \eqno(4)
$$
where we have used the notation
$$
\varkappa_k (\Phi)=\Phi-\gamma\lambda_k+\sqrt{\Phi^2-2\gamma\lambda_k\Phi+\lambda_k}.
$$
Then, in the phase space $H_0^1(\Omega)\times L_2(\Omega)$, there exists a $2N$-dimensional
inertial manifold that exponentially attracts $($as $t\to+\infty)$ all the solutions of
problem~\textup{(1), (2)}.
\end{theorem}

The proof is based on the construction of a new inner product in the phase space in which gap
property holds and thus an inertial manifold exists (the corresponding general theorem for an
abstract differential equation in a Hilbert space one can find,
e.g., in \cite{gc-2005}).

Remark. If $\gamma$, $\lambda_N$ and $\lambda_{N+1}$ are fixed and they satisfy (3), then we state
the existence of an inetial manifold for sufficiently small $L$.

%% Abstract in English:

The report is based on joint works with M.I.Vishik.

We describe the method of trajectory dynamical systems and
trajectory attractors and we apply this approach to the study of
the limiting asymptotic behaviour of solutions of non-linear
evolution equations. This method is especially useful in the study
of dissipative equations of mathematical physics for which the
corresponding Cauchy initial-value problem has a global (weak)
solution with respect to the time but the uniqueness of this
solution either has not been established or does not hold. An
important example of such an equation is the 3D Navier--Stokes
system in a bounded domain  (see \cite{CVbook}). In such a
situation one cannot use directly the classical scheme of
construction of a dynamical system in the phase space of initial
conditions of the Cauchy problem of a given equation and find a
global attractor of this dynamical system. Nevertheless, for such
equations it is possible to construct a trajectory dynamical system
and investigate a trajectory attractor of the corresponding
translation semigroup.

This universal method is applied for various types of equations
arising in mathematical physics: for general dissipative
reaction-diffusion systems, for the 3D Navier--Stokes system, for
dissipative wave equations, for non-linear elliptic equations in
cylindrical domains, and for other equations and systems. Special
attention is given to using the method of trajectory attractors in
approximation and perturbation problems arising in complicated
models of mathematical physics.

quantum version (introduced in  \cite{GHGO-2005}) of the  Zakharov system
arising in plasma physics:
\begin{equation*}
\left\{\begin{array}{l}
n_{tt}-\Delta\left(n+|E|^2\right)+h^2\Delta^2 n+\alpha n_t  =f(x),
\quad x\in\Omega,\; t>0,
\\ \\
i E_t+\Delta E- h^2\Delta^2E  +i\gamma E - n E=g(x),\quad x\in\Omega,\; t>0.
\end{array}\right.
\end{equation*}
Here $\Omega \subset \R^d$ is a bounded domain, $d\le 3$,
$E(x,t)$ is a complex function
and $n(x,t)$ is a real one, $h>0$,  $\alpha\ge 0$
and $\gamma\ge 0$ are  parameters and $f(x)$, $g(x)$ are given
(real and complex) functions. We also impose some boundary and initial conditions
on $E$ and $n$.
\par
We prove the global well-posedness
of this problem in some Sobolev type classes and study properties of
solutions.  This result confirms the conclusion
recently made in physical literature concerning
the absence of collapse in the quantum Langmuir waves.
(see a discussion in \cite{SSS-2009}). 
In the dissipative case the existence of a
finite dimensional global attractor
is  established and regularity properties
of this attractor are studied. For this we use the recently
developed method of  quasi-stability estimates (see \cite{ChuLas,cl-book}).
In the case when external loads are
$C^\infty$ functions we show that every trajectory  from the attractor
is $C^\infty$ both in time and spatial variables.
This can be interpret as the absence of sharp coherent
structures in the limiting dynamics.  For some details we refer to 
\cite{Chu11}.

%% Abstract in English:

Control over thermonuclear fusion reactions
(including suppression of instabilities of the plasma discharge)
depends essentially on how well the information about the current
density through plasma is taken into account. In the case
cylindrical approximation (when the tokamak (toroidal magnetic)
chamber and the resulting plasma discharge are modeled in the form
of infinite cylinders ${\mathcal S}\times\R$ and~$\omega\times\R$
with simply connected cross-sections ${\mathcal S}\Subset\R^2$
and~$\omega\Subset{\mathcal S}$), the required current
distribution is given by the mapping
$
f_{u}:\omega\ni (x,y)\mapsto f\bigl(u(x,y)\bigl)\ge 0,
$
where the \textit{required} functions $u\in C^2(\omega)$ and~$f$
are as follows:
\begin{equation*}\label{0.2}
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial y^2}=f\bigl(u(x,y)\bigl)
\quad \ {\rm in}\quad \omega\,,\quad \ {\rm and}\quad \ u=0\quad {\rm on}\quad
\gamma=\partial\omega,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}\label{0.3}
\sup\limits_{P\in\gamma}\Bigl|\frac{\partial
u}{\partial\nu}(P)-~\Phi(P)\Bigl|\le\lambda\sup\limits_{P\in\gamma}\Bigl|\Phi(P)\Bigl|
\,,\qquad \int_{\gamma}\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu}\,d\gamma=1
=\mbox{the total current}\,.
\end{equation*}
Here, $\gamma=\overline{\omega}\setminus\omega$ is the boundary of
the domain $\omega$, $\lambda\ge 0$ is small parameter, $\nu$ is
the outward  unit normal to the curve~$\gamma=\partial\omega$
(with respect to the domain~$\omega)$. Both the function~$\Phi$
and the curve $\gamma=\partial\omega$ (and hence the
domain~$\omega$) may be regarded as known: they are determinable
from measurements of the magnetic field at the tokamak chamber
$\partial {\mathcal S}.$

Within the class of affine functions~$f: u\mapsto f(u)=au+b$,
Vishik--\allowbreak Lyusternik's method is capable of showing that
\begin{equation*}\label{uasymp}
\left|\frac{{\partial } u}{{\partial
}\nu}\biggl|_{s\in\gamma}-\left(\frac1{|\gamma|}-
\frac{k(s)-|\gamma|^{-1}\int_\gamma k(s)\,ds}{2|\gamma|\sqrt{a}}\right)\right|\le
\frac{C_{\gamma}(a)}{\sqrt{a}}\,,
\ C_{\gamma}(a)\to 0\;\; \text{as}\;\;
a\to\infty\,,
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}\label{Vasump}
\left|\frac{d}{d a}\frac{{\partial } u}{{\partial
}\nu}\biggl|_{s\in\gamma}-\; \frac{k(s)-|\gamma|^{-1}\int_\gamma
k(s)\,ds}{4|\gamma|\,{a}^{3/2}}\right|\le
\frac{C_{\gamma}(a)}{a^{3/2}}\,,\quad C_{\gamma}(a)\to 0\quad
\text{as}\quad
a\to\infty\,,
\end{equation*}
where $k(s)$ is the curvature of~$\gamma$ at~$s\in\gamma$. Using
these asymptotic relations, it follows that there is only one
affine distribution $f_u$ (for a~large class of domains~$\omega$)
if $\lambda\overset{}{=}0$. However, for any arbitrarily small
$\lambda>0$, there is an infinite number
$\{f^j_u\}_{j\in\mathbb{N}}$ of distributions, for which
$\|f^{j_1}_u\|\ll\|f^{j_2}_u\|$, $j_1\ne j_2$, where $\|f^j_u\|=
\max\limits_{(x,y)\in\omega}\left|f^j_u(x,y)\right|\,.$
It is shown that all these different distributions are necessarily
members of a~sequence converging to the $\delta$-function
supported on~$\gamma$ (the so-called skinned current). Hence these
distributions are not essentially different from the physical
standpoint.

Two truly physically essentially different current distributions
$f^1_{u}$ and $f^2_{u}$ are found in the class of polynomials~$f:
u\mapsto f(u)=\sum_{m=0}^3a_mu^m$ of third degree (see
Russian J.~Math.\ Physics, {\bf 17}~(1), 56--65 (2010) and
Asymptotic Analysis, {\bf 74}~(1), 95--121  (2011)).

%% Abstract in English:

One use the averaging methods for partial differential equations in the case when their coefficients are rapidly oscillating functions. There exists a great number of publications devoted to averaging, we mention well known monographes by V.Zhikov, S.Kozlov and O.Oleinik, N.Bakhvalov and G.Panasenko, E.Khruslov and V.Marchenko. As a rule averaging methods are used for  construction such asymptotic solutions that their leading term is quite smooth function. From the other hand there exist interesting. The several scale are  in this situation and it  reasonable to use the variant of adiabatic approximation based on the V.Maslov operator methods and pseudodifferential operators. We illustrate this approach using the Sr\"odiger and Klien-Gordon type equations with rapidly oscillating velocity and potential.

%% Abstract in English:
The second quantization of a complexified Gelfand triple produces   the   Kree nuclear triple of sesqui-holomorphic functionals on it. Any continuous operator in the Kree triple  is a  pseudovariational operator, a strong limit of second quantized   pseudodifferential operators on  $\mathbb{R}^n,\ n\rightarrow \infty$. 


A thorough  analysis of the Noether Yang-Mills energy functional of Cauchy data shows that it is  the anti-normal symbol of a selfadjoint elliptic operator in variational  derivatives. Such quantum Yang-Mills energy operator  has  a mass  gap at the bottom of its  spectrum. This is a solution of the Yang-Mills Millennium problem.

%% Abstract in English:
Energy estimate is very important tool to study 3D Navier--Stokes system.
Absents of such bound in phase space $H^1$ is very serious obstacle to prove 
nonlocal existence of smooth solutions.  

Semilinear parabolic equation is called equation of normal type if its nonlinear term $B$
satisfies the condition: vector $B(v)$ is collinear to vector $v$ for each $v$. Since the property
$B(v)\perp v$ implies energy estimate, equation of normal type does not satisfies energy estimate 
"`in the most degree"'. That is why we hope that investigation of normal parabolic equations should make
more clear a number problems connected with existence of nonlocal smooth solutions to 3D Navier--Stokes equations.

In the talk we will start from Helmholtz equations that is analog of 3D Navier--Stokes system in which the curl
of fluid velocity is unknown function. We will derive normal parabolic equations (NPE) corresponding to Helmholtz equations and will prove that there exists explicit formula for solution to NPE with periodic boundary conditions.
This helped us to investigate more less completely the structure of dynamical flow corresponding to NPE.
Its phase space $V$ can be decomposed on the set of stability $M_-(\alpha ),\; \alpha >0$ (solutions with initial condition $\omega_0 \in M_-(\alpha )$ tends to zero with prescribed rate $e^{-\alpha t}$ as time $t\to \infty $), set of explosions $M_+$ (solutions with initial condition $\omega_0 \in M_+$ blow up during finite time),
and intermediate set $M_I(\alpha )=V\setminus (M_-(\alpha)\cup M_+)$. The exact description of all these sets
will be given.

We consider the algebra
$C_u = C_u (\R)$
of uniformly continuous bounded complex functions on the real line $\R$
with pointwise operations and sup-norm. Let $I$ be a closed ideal in $C_u$
invariant with respect to translations, and let $\mathrm{ah}_I (f )$
denote the minimal real number (if it exists)
satisfying the following condition. If
$\lambda > \mathrm{ah}_I (f )$, then $(\hat f - \hat g )|_V = 0$
for some $g_I$ , where $V$ is
a neighborhood of the point $\lambda$.
The classical Titchmarsh convolution theorem is equivalent to the
equality
$\mathrm{ah}_I (f_1 \cdot f_2 ) = \mathrm{ah}_I (f_1 ) + \mathrm{ah}_I (f_2 )$,
where $I = \{0\}$.
We show that, for ideals $I$ of general
form, this equality does not generally hold,
but $\mathrm{ah}_I (f^n ) = n \cdot \mathrm{ah}_I (f )$ holds for any $I$.
We present
many nontrivial ideals for which the general form
of the Titchmarsh theorem is true.

%% Abstract in English:
Given a non-negative $L_{loc}^{1}$ function $V\left( x\right) $ on $\mathbb{R%
}^{n}$, consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator
$
H_{V}=-\Delta -V
$
where $\Delta =\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{\partial ^{2}}{\partial x_{k}^{2}}$ is
the Laplace operator. More precisely, $H_{V}$ is defined as a form sum of $%
-\Delta $ and $-V$, so that, under certain assumptions about $V$, the
operator $H_{V}$ is self-adjoint in $L^{2}\left( \mathbb{R}^{n}\right) $.

Denote by $\mathrm{Neg}\left( V\right) $ the number of non-positive
eigenvalues of $H_{V}$ (counted with multiplicity), assuming that its
spectrum in $(-\infty ,0]$ is discrete. For example, the latter is the case
when $V\left( x\right) \rightarrow 0$ as $x\rightarrow \infty $. We are are
interested in obtaining estimates of $\mathrm{Neg}\left( V\right) $ in terms
of the potential $V$ in the case $n=2.$

For the operator $H_{V}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $n\geq 3$ a celebrated
inequality of Cwikel-Lieb-Rozenblum says that%
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Neg}\left( V\right) \leq C_{n}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}V\left( x\right)
^{n/2}dx.  \label{CLR}
\end{equation}%
For $n=2$ this inequality is not valid. Moreover, no weighted $L^{1}$-norm
of $V$ can provide an upper bound for $\mathrm{Neg}\left( V\right) .$ In fact,
in the case $n=2$ instead of the upper bounds, the lower bound in (\ref{CLR}%
) is true.

The main result is the estimate (\ref{NegIn}) below that was obtained
jointly with N.Nadira\-shvili. For any $n\in \mathbb{Z}$, set 
\[
U_{n} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
\{e^{2^{n-1}}<\left\vert x\right\vert <e^{2^{n}}\},\ \ n>0, \\
\{e^{-1}<\left\vert x\right\vert <e\}, \ \ n=0,
\\
\{e^{-2^{\left\vert n\right\vert }}<\left\vert x\right\vert
<e^{-2^{\left\vert n\right\vert -1}}\},\ \ n<0.
\end{array}
\right.
\]
Define for any $n\in \mathbb{Z}$ the following quantities:%
\begin{equation*}
A_{n}=\int\limits_{U_{n}}V\left( x\right) \left( 1+\left\vert \ln \left\vert
x\right\vert \right\vert \right) dx\ ,\ \ \text{ }\ B_{n}=\Big(
\int\limits_{\left\{ e^{n}<\left\vert x\right\vert <e^{n+1}\right\}
}V^{p}\left( x\right) \left\vert x\right\vert ^{2\left( p-1\right)
}dx\Big) ^{1/p},
\end{equation*}%
where $p>1$ is fixed. Then the following estimate holds%
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{Neg}\left( V\right) \leq 1+C\sum_{\left\{ n\in \mathbb{Z}%
:A_{n}>c\right\} }\sqrt{A_{n}}+C\sum_{\left\{ n\in \mathbb{Z}%
:B_{n}>c\right\} }B_{n},  \label{NegIn}
\end{equation}%
where $C,c$ are positive constants depending only on $p$.

For example, (\ref{NegIn}) implies the finiteness of $\mathrm{Neg}\left(
V\right) $ provided $V$ is locally bounded and 
%\begin{equation*}
$
V\left( x\right) =o\Big( \frac{1}{\left\vert x\right\vert ^{2}\ln
^{2}\left\vert x\right\vert }\Big) \ \ \text{as }x\rightarrow \infty ,
$
%\end{equation*}%
which cannot be seen by any previously known method.

%% Abstract in English:
We consider initial--boundary value problem for linearized equations of viscous
barotropic fluid motion in a bounded domain. We briefly discuss results on
existence, uniqueness and estimates of weak solutions to this problem
(see \cite{IKM,MZ02,G11}).
Then we focus on the asymptotic behaviour of the solutions as the 
compressibility tends to zero, i.e. on the passage to so-called
\emph{incompressible limit} (see \cite{LM98,FN07}).
Briefly, we show that
\begin{itemize}
\item in general case the velocity field converges \emph{weakly} in $L^2(0,T;H_0^1)$;
\item if the initial condition for the velocity is divergence-free
then the velocity converges \emph{strongly} and the pressure
converges $*$-\emph{weakly} in $L^\infty(0,T;L^2)$;
\item if, in addition, the \emph{initial condition} for the pressure
is compatible with the \emph{initial value} of the pressure
in the incompressible problem then the convergence of
the pressure is \emph{strong}. (A similar compatibility condition
was obtained in \cite{Sh99} as a \emph{necessary condition} of strong
convergence of the solutions.)
\end{itemize}
We also demonstrate the necessity of these sufficient conditions using
explicit solutions which are available for simplified data.

%% Abstract in English:

Let $V,  H $  be two real Hilbert spaces,  $V\subset H$ with compact and dense imbedding and let $A: V\rightarrow V' $ be bounded, self ajoint and coercive.  Under reasonable assumptions on $g$ , a  compactness property of the range is established for energy-bounded solutions of an abstract equation 
$$ u'' + Au + g(u') = h(t), \quad t\ge 0$$ when $h$ is $S^1$-uniformly continuous with values in $H$. This property allows to deduce\,:\smallskip

\noindent
1) asymptotic almost-periodicity of all solutions of wave or plate equations in presence of an almost-periodic source term when the damping term is strong enough.
\smallskip

\noindent
2) convergence to equilibrium of all solutions of some equations of the form 
$$ u'' + Au + f(u) + g(u') = h(t), \quad t\ge 0$$ when f is the gradient of a potential satisfying the {\L}ojasiewicz gradient inequality, $g$ is sufficiently coercive globally and $h(t) \rightarrow 0$  sufficiently fast for $t$ tending to infinity. 

\smallskip

These results generalize, mainly to the case of non-local damping terms,  some previous works by the author and his colleagues and rely on methods developped during more than 30 years, cf. e.g. \cite{haraux1, haraux2, haraux3} for applications of type 1) and \cite{haraux4,haraux5} for applications of type 2). There are still challenging open problems in this direction which will be mentionned during the lecture.

Understanding of the structure of attractors of generic dynamical systems
is one of the major goals of the theory.
%%AC of these systems.
A vast general
program suggested by Palis  presents numerous conjectures
about this structure. Various particular cases of these conjectures are proved
in numerous papers that we do not quote here.
Main part of these investigations is related to diffeomorphisms  of closed manifolds.
Our investigation is
%%AC in a sense
parallel to this direction of research. In the first part of the talk,
attractors of  \emph{manifolds with boundary onto themselves} are studied. At present, locally generic
properties of  attractors of such maps are established, that are not yet observed
(and plausibly do not hold)  for the case of closed manifolds.
For instance, an open set of diffeomorphisms  of manifolds with boundary onto themselves
may have attractors with intermingled basins.
The strongest result of this kind
is
% obtained
% by Kleptsyn and Saltykov
in
\cite{KS}.

Another property of this kind is \emph{having thick attractors}.
It is a general belief that attractors of typical smooth dynamical systems
(diffeomorphisms and flows) on closed manifolds
either coincide with the whole phase space
or have Lebesgue measure zero. In this talk we show that this is not the fact
for diffeomorphisms  of manifolds with boundary onto themselves. Namely, in the space of diffeomorphisms  of
%a product 
$T^2  \times [0,1]$, there exists an open set such that  any map from a complement of this set
to a countable number of hypersurfaces,  has a
thick attractor: a transitive attractor that has positive Lebesgue measure together with its complement \cite{I11}.
The problem whether
%or not
thick
attractors exist for locally generic diffeomorphisms
of a closed manifold remains  widely open.

In the second part we study so called bony attractors. These are attractors of
skew products over a Bernoulli shift with the following unexpected property:
the map has an invariant manifold, and the intersection of the attractor with
that manifold, called \emph{a bone}, is much larger than the attractor of the restriction of the map
to the invariant manifold.  Bony attractors with one-dimensional bones
were discovered in \cite{K10}.
We construct bones of arbitrary dimension \cite{I12}.
It is expected that bony attractors are in a sense locally generic.

%% Abstract in English:

For a function $\varphi\in H^1(\mathbb{R})$ the following inequality
is  well known
$$
\|\varphi\|_\infty^2\le \|\varphi\|\|\varphi'\|,
$$
where the norms on the right-hand side are the $L_2$-norms.
The constant $1$ in the  inequality is  sharp
and the unique extremal unction is
$
\varphi^*(x)=e^{-|x|}
$.
The same inequality clearly holds on a finite interval,
that is, for $\varphi\in H^1_0(0,L)$. However, since
$\varphi^*(x)>0$, no extremal functions exist.
The following result provides a sharp correction term
for this inequality (the correction term in the periodic case
was found in \cite{Zelik}).

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Theorem 1.}
{\it Let $f\in H^1_0(0,L)$. Then
$
\ \|\varphi\|^2_\infty\le\|\varphi\|\|\varphi'\|\bigl(1-2e^{-\frac{L\|\varphi'\|}{\|\varphi\|}}\bigr).
$

\noindent
The  coefficients of the two terms on the right-hand side
are sharp and no extremal functions exist.}
\medskip



As in the periodic case considered in~\cite{JST}, this theorem makes
it possible to obtain a simultaneous bound for the negative
trace and the number of negative eigenvalues for the
1D Schr\"odinger eigenvalue problem on $(0,L)$
\begin{equation}
\label{Sch}
-y''_j-Vy_j=\nu_jy_j
\end{equation}
with Dirichlet boundary conditions $y(0)=y(L)=0$
and potential $V(x)\ge0$.

\medskip
\noindent
{\bf Theorem 2.}
{\it Suppose that there exist $N$ negative eigenvalues $\nu_j\le0$, %$\nu_j\ge0$,
$j=1,\dots,N$ of the operator~\eqref{Sch}. Then
both the negative trace and the number $N$ of negative
eigenvalues satisfy for any $\varepsilon\ge0$
$$
\sum_{j=1}^N|\nu_j|+N\cdot\frac{\pi^2}{L^2}
\biggl(\frac{c(\varepsilon)}{1+\varepsilon}\biggr)^{2}\le
\frac{2}{3\sqrt{3}}\cdot
(1+\varepsilon)\int_0^{L}V(x)^{3/2}dx,
$$
where
$
c(\varepsilon)=\min_{x\ge1}\bigl(\varepsilon x+2xe^{-\pi x}\bigr)
$.
}

\medskip
\noindent
{\it Remark.} We have  $c(\varepsilon)\ge\varepsilon$, and the optimal
$\varepsilon$ for the
bound involving only the number of negative eigenvalues $N$
is $\varepsilon=2$.

\medskip

The theory of global uniform attractors of non-autonomous differential systems has been constructed in \cite{ipatova1}. It is important in applications how close the attractors of discrete approximations to mathematical models are to their true attractors. For autonomous equations, this problem was studied in \cite{ipatova2}, where a theorem on the semicontinuous dependence of attractors of
a family of semidynamical systems on the parameter was proved. A similar result was obtained in \cite{ipatova3} for uniform attractors of families of semiprocesses corresponding to non-autonomous evolution
equations. It was assumed in \cite{ipatova2,ipatova3} that the considered families have a common time semigroup;
therefore, when studying finite-difference, the grid increment was represented in the form $\tau =\tau_n=T_0/n$ where $T_0$ is some positive number and $n\in {\mathbb N}$.
In this paper we prove a theorem on the upper semi-continuous dependence on the parameter of the uniform attractors of families of semiprocesses \cite{ipatova4} which allows us to investigate the convergence of the attractors of the numerical schemes in which the discretization parameter is not subjected to any law and can tend to zero in an arbitrary manner.
This result is applied to the study of the uniform attractor of the explicit finite-difference scheme for the Lorenz system with time-dependent coefficients \cite{ipatova5}.

The work was supported by the Federal Program "Scientific and Scientific-Educational Staff of Innovative Russia" for years 2009-2013.

%% Abstract in English:

In a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ with sufficiently
smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$ we consider the problem
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{array}
[c]{l}%
u_{t}-\Delta u+f(u)=h,\quad x\in\Omega,\ t>0,\\
u|_{\partial\Omega}=0,
\end{array}
\right. \label{ka1}%
\end{equation}
where $f\in C(\mathbb{R})$ satisfies suitable growth and dissipative
conditions, but there is no condition ensuring uniqueness of the
Cauchy problem. When the nonlinear term $f$ is smooth and $f'$
satisfies additional assumptions, it is well known
\cite{BabinVishik1989}, that the problem (\ref{ka1}) generates semigroup,
which has global attractor and it coincides with the unstable set,
emanating from the set of stationary points and with stable one as
well. In general case (2), when the uniqueness of Cauchy problem is
not guaranteed, we have existence of trajectory attractor
\cite{ChepVishik2002}, and existence of global attractor of
multivalued semiflow \cite{KapValero2010}. Our aim is to study the
structure of the global attractor in multi-valued case. We prove
that the attractor of the multi-valued semiflow generated by all
weak solutions of (\ref{ka1}) in the phase space $L^{2}\left( \Omega\right)
$ is the closure of the union of all stable manifolds of the set of
stationary points. Also,
for multi-valued semiflow,
generated by regular solutions,  we prove the existence of  global
attractor,  which is compact in $H_{0}^{1}\left( \Omega\right) $ and
we establish that it is the union of all unstable manifolds of the
set of stationary points and of the stable ones as well.

%% Abstract in English:

We consider the Klein-Gordon equation
in the discrete space-time
interacting with a nonlinear oscillator.
In \cite{kg-discrete-arxiv},
we prove that the weak attractor of all
finite energy solutions
coincides with the set of all
multifrequency solitary waves,
\[
\sum\sb{j=1}\sp{N}\phi\sb j(x)e^{-i\omega\sb j t},
\qquad
(x,\,t)\in\Z^n\times\Z,
\quad
\phi\sb j\in l\sp 2(\Z^n),
\quad
\omega\sb j\in\R\mod 2\pi.
\]
More precisely, we show that
there are only one-, two-, and four-frequency solitary waves.
In the continuous limit,
only the one-frequency solitary waves survive.
The convergence to the attractor takes place weakly
(on finite subsets or in the weighted norms).
The proof is based on a version
of the Titchmarsh convolution
theorem proved for distributions
supported on a circle \cite{titchmarsh-circle}.

The result generalizes an earlier
result for the Klein-Gordon equation
in the continuous space-time \cite{ubk-arma}.

discrepancy among three different currencies in the foreign
exchange market is called triangular arbitrage (also referred to as
cross currency arbitrage or three-point arbitrage). The commonly
recognized belief in economics and finance is that
\begin{quote}
\ldots Arbitrage has the effect of causing prices in different
markets to converge. As a result of arbitrage, the currency
exchange rates, the price of commodities, and the price of
securities in different markets tend to converge\ldots
\end{quote}
see, e.g. \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage}.

In the talk, the triangle arbitrage operations will be reformulated
in terms of the so-called asynchronous systems. This will allow to
disprove the above belief by a set of examples. It will be
demonstrated that the foreign exchange currency market may exhibit
periodical regimes and exponential growth of exchange rates but
also unexpectedly strong instability: the so-called
double-exponential growth of exchange rates.

%% Abstract in English:
Consider an abstract operator equation  $x=F(x,\lambda)$ in a Banach space $X$
(all constructions are interesting even in $\R^{2}$) with
compact and continuous operator $F$ depending on a parameter $\lambda\in\Lambda$.
Here $\Lambda$ is a compact set, say an interval or the circle $S^{1}$.
The set of all solutions of the equation  $x=F(x,\lambda)$ in the space
$X\times\Lambda$ may have very complicated form (e.g. may have a fractal structure).
However, these sets have some common properties,
for example such sets are always compact.
Under generic topological assumptions (partially, if $F$ satisfies the Schauder principle conditions:
it maps some ball in its interior part) such equations
always have large connected components.
The first results in this direction were obtained by Mark Krasnosel'skii
in 50's, later his ideas were continued and developed by various authors.

In my talk I would like to present some new results
on the structure of the solution sets for generic operator equations.
Possible applications to boundary value problems are evident,
as an example I present some statements on nontrivial asymptotic bifurcation
points in the problems on periodic forced oscillations
for higher order ODE.
In these statements the set of all solutions
in the space $X\times\Lambda$ is nonconnected and consists
from the infinite sequence of bounded cyclic branches
going to infinity.

%% Abstract in English:

We here deal with the Stokes-Leibenson problem for a
punctual Hele-Shaw flow. By using a geometrical transformation
inspired by Helmholtz-Kirchhoff method, we introduce an
integro-differential problem which leads to the construction of
a discrete model.
We first give a short recall about the source-case: global in time
existence and uniqueness result for an initial contour close to a
circular one, investigation of the evolutionary structure of the solution.
Our main subject concerns the development of a numerical model
in order to get some qualitative properties of the motion.
This model provides numerical experiments which confirm the
existence of a critical manifold of codimension 1 in some space
of contours.
This manifold contains one attractive point in the source-case
corresponding to a circular contour centered at the source-point.
In the sink-case, every point of this manifold seems to be attractive.
In particular, we present some numerical experiments linked to
fingering effects.

It was assumed that the Cauchy problem for the limit of the parabolic equation has a unique solution.

%% Abstract in English:


%%Its influence and further development.

In his pioneering paper \cite{Vis52} M.I. Vishik proposed a new
approach to the extension theory of symmetric operators as well as
dual pairs of operators in a Hilbert space. In the framework of
this approach the proper extensions are parameterized in terms of
(abstract) boundary conditions. Moreover, he applied
general constructions to investigate  %%some spectral properties
the properties of solvability and complete solvability  of
boundary value problems for (not necessarily symmetric) elliptic
operators on bounded domains.


During three last decades this approach has been formalized in the
concept of boundary triplets for dual pairs of operators and 
elaborated in great detail.  The revival of interest to this
approach  has been motivated by numerous applications to boundary
value problems for differential and difference operators (see for
instance publications \cite{Grubb68}, \cite{BroGruWoo09},
\cite{KosMal10}, \cite{Mal10} and references therin).


I plan to recall the main results and basic constructions of the
Vishik's paper  \cite{Vis52} as well as  to discuss  its influence
on development of the extensions theory.
%%of symmetric operators as well as dual pairs of operators will be discussed.

Next I plan to discuss  applications of to elliptic boundary value
problems in domain with compact boundary. Some spectral properties
of different realizations of elliptic differential expressions
will be discussed too.

%% Abstract in English:


\vspace*{3mm}
We consider the system
\[
M\frac{d^{2}x_{i}}{dt^{2}}=-\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_{i}}+F(x_{i})-A\frac{dx_{i}}{dt},i=1,...,N
\]
of $N$ ordinary differential equations describing Newtonian dynamics
of $N$ particles (electrons), initially at the points 
\[
x_{1}(0)<x_{2}(0)<...<x_{N}(0),
\]
on the interval $[0,L)\in R$ with periodic boundary conditions, that
is on the circle of length $L$. Here $M>0,A\geq0$ are the parameters,
$F(x)$ is the external force, and 
\[
U(x_{1},...,x_{N})=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\alpha}{|x_{i+1}-x_{1}|}.\alpha>0,
\]
(where of course $x_{N+1}\equiv x_{1}$) is the Coulomb repulsive
interaction between nearest neighbors.

We review new results concerning this system: fixed points, quasi-homogeneous
regime (Ohm's law) and very fast propagation of the ``effective''
external field, which is initially zero on the most part of the circle.

All these phenomena are closely related to many problems with DC (direct
electric current), that the statistical physics was unable to understand.
The following is a picturesque description of one of DC enigmas in
the famous Feynman lectures, v. 6, pp. 33-34: ``The force pushes
the electrons along the wire. But why does this move the galvanometer,
whis is so far from the force? Because when the electrons which feel
the magnetic force try to move, they push - by electric repulsion
- the electrons a little farther down the wire; they, in turn, repel
the electrons a little farther on, and so on for a long distance.
An amazing thing. It was so amazing to Gauss and Weber - who first
built a galvanometer - that they tried to see how far the forces in
the wire would go. They strung the wire all the way across the city.''

We discuss asymptotic solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations,
describing periodic collections of vortices in 3D space.
These solutions are connected with topological invariants
of divergence-free vector fields.
Equations, describing evolution of vortices,
are defined on a graph -- Reeb graph of the stream function
or Fomenko molecule of the Liouville foliation.
Homogenization with respect to
the periodic structure leads to equations
coinciding with Reynolds equations.
It is well known that existence of the Reynolds stresses leads
to the growth of the energy and entropy of the fluid.
As the entropy reaches certain critical value,
the molecules of the fluid have to form
``clusters'' which leads to the occurrence of turbulence.

We study the  minimum-time damping of a physical pendulum by means of a

finite number of control switchings from  the maximal to the minimal value. If one considers
simultaneously all optimal trajectories with any initial state, the number of switchings can be
arbitrary large. We show that for the nonlinear pendulum there is a uniform bound for the switching
number for all optimal trajectories. We find asymptotics for this bound as the control amplitude
goes to zero.

%% Abstract 
The talk is devoted to the linear multi-dimensional functional operator
$$
(\mathcal{P}F)(x):=\sum^N_{j=1} c_j(x) (F\circ a_j)(x),\;\; x\in D\subset \mathbb{R}^n.
$$
Here $F\in C(I)$ with $I=(-1,1)$ and $|F|$ norm in $C$, {\it coefficients} $c_j$ and {\it arguments} $a_j$ of $\mathcal{P}$ are continuous functions $D\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $D\rightarrow I$, respectively; $D$ is a domain with compact closure. These operators are of interest both in Analysis and in applying fields. If time allows I'll mention some problems in Integral geometry and PDE closely connected with them. As to the intrinsic problems relating to the operator $\mathcal{P}$ we'll discuss {\it the asymptotic behavior} of solutions to the equation $\mathcal{P}u=h_\varepsilon$ depending on a small parameter $\varepsilon\rightarrow 0$ under condition $h_\varepsilon=O(\varepsilon)$. Recent speaker's results make significally more precise analogous information based on the solution to well known Ulam problem. It turned out that this problem ( as it is formulated in his book "A Collection of  Mathematical Problems") is not well posed: the input information ($|\mathcal{P}F(x)|<\varepsilon $  for {\it all} $x\in D$) is redundant. As a matter of fact, to describe the asymptotic behavior of the function $F$ the latter relation should be valid only at points $x$ of some one-dimensional submanifold $\Gamma\subset D$ (subject to determining), but not everywhere in $D$. This result will be discussed together with a new Inverse problem for the equation $\mathcal{P}F=H_\varepsilon$ (reconstruction  of the operator $\mathcal{P}$ using the given asymptotic behavior of the solution $F$).

%% Abstract in English:

A time dependence for second-order and third-order longitudinal
correlation functions are considered in the intermittency model
\cite{pyr1}, i.e. we use the following model: flow is considered as a
mixture of turbulent and viscous regimes.
Both regimes have Loitsyansky invariants and Kolmogorov's (for turbulent regime) and Millionshchikov's
(for viscous regime) self-similarities.

Gradient hypothesis of Lytkin and Chernykh \cite{pyr2} is used to make
Karman-Howarth equation closed by the expression of the two-point
third-order correlation moment  through the two-point second-order
correlation moment  in the regime of Kolmogorov turbulence in the
inertial range.

A model dependence obtained for the longitudinal correlation
coefficient has asymptotically  exponential form of decay and is in
good agreement with the experimental data of
Batchelor-Townsend-Stewart \cite{pyr3}.

The kinetic theory considers the gas as a collection of a huge number of randomly moving particles, in some way interacting with each other.
As a result of these interactions the particles exchange momenta and energies.
Interaction can be through direct collisions or by certain forces.
To elucidate the mathematical scheme describing such phenomena,
we consider \cite{radkevich1} the so-called discrete kinetic Boltsmann equations
and give a phenomenological derivation of the Boltsmann equation

A branching random motion on a line,

The

A solution of a certain hyperbolic system of coupled non-linear

%% Abstract in English:

Manifolds $M$ with higher corners or edges of order  $k \in \mathbb{N}$ are (in our notation) special stratified spaces, where $k=0$ corresponds to smoothness, $k = 1$ to conical or edge singularities, especially smooth boundaries. Manifolds with singularities of order $k$ form a category $ \mathcal{M}_k.$ The stratification $s(M)=(s_0(M),s_1(M),\dots ,s_k(M))$  induces a principal symbolic hierarchy $$\sigma (A)=(\sigma _0(A),\sigma _1(A),\dots ,\sigma _k(A))$$ of operators $A$ over $s_0(M),$ degenerate in a typical way in the representation over the stretched version $\mathbb{M}$ of $M.$ The component $\sigma_0(A)$ is the standard homogeneous principal symbol on the main stratum $s_0(M)$; the component $\sigma_j(A),\,j>0,$ lives on $s_k(M))$ and is operator-valued. The symbolic hierarchy admits notions of ellipticity and the construction of parametrices within suitable algebras of degenerate pseudo-differential operators. We present some new developments in this field which has a long history through achievements of numerous Russian authors and other schools worldwide. Further progress is stimulated by the desire to reach new models of applications, see, for instance, \cite{Flad3}. Moreover, the tower of operator algebras with increasing $k$ still contains many new challenges. The methods of the author have been stimulated very much by the works \cite{Vivs2}, \cite{Vivs3}, \cite{Eski2}, since the case of manifolds with edge contains boundary value problems with and without the transmission property at the boundary.

We consider 2D Navie--Stokes equations in a bounded domain with smooth boundary and discuss the interconnection between controllability for the deterministic problem and mixing properties of the associated random dynamics. Namely, we first consider the problem of stabilisation of a given non-stationary solution, assuming that the control is localised in space and time and is finite-dimensional as a function of both variables. We next replace the control by a random force and prove that the resulting random dynamical system is exponentially mixing in the Kantorovich--Wasserstein distance. Some of the results of this talk are obtained in collaboration with V. Barbu and S. Rodrigues.

Consider the motion of ideal incompressible fluid in a bounded
domain (or on a compact Riemannian manifold). The configuration space of
the fluid is the group of volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the flow
domain, and the flows are geodesics on this infinite-dimensional group
where the metric is defined by the kinetic energy. The geodesic equation is
the Lagrange-Euler equation. The problem usually studied is the initial
value problem, where we look for a geodesic with given initial fluid
configuration and initial velocity field. In this talk we consider a
different problem: find a geodesic connecting two given fluid
configurations. The main result is the following

\smallskip

\noindent{\bf Theorem:}
{\it Suppose the flow domain is a 2-dimensional torus. Then for any two
fluid configurations there exists a geodesic connecting them. This means
that, given arbitrary fluid configuration (diffeomorphism), we can "push"
the fluid along some initial velocity field, so that by time one the fluid,
moving according to the Lagrange-Euler equation, assumes the given
configuration.}

\smallskip

This theorem looks superficially like the Hopf-Rinow theorem for
finite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds. In fact, these two theorems have
almost nothing in common. In our case, unlike the Hopf-Rinow theorem, the
geodesic is not, in general case, the shortest curve connecting the
endpoints (fluid configurations). Moreover, the length minimizing curve can
not exist at all, while the geodesic always exists.

The proof is based on some ideas of global analysis (Fredholm quasilinear
maps) and microlocal analysis of the Lagrange-Euler equation (which may be
called a ``microglobal analysis'').

%% Abstract in English:

Let T be an open and regular triangular pyramid (tetrahedron) in the space $\R^3$ with a
boundary $\p\Gamma$.
Let $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, $\sigma$
are barycentric coordinates of a point $(x, y, z) \in \R^3$
with respect to
tetrahedron $T$ which can be expressed in the variables $x,\, y,\, z$.

\medskip

\noindent
{\bf Theorem.}
The function $w =\sin(\alpha\pi/2)\sin(\beta\pi/2)\sin(\gamma\pi/2)\sin(\sigma\pi/2)$
is the eigenfunction of the
Laplace operator $\Delta\equiv
\frac{\p^2}{\p x^2}+\frac{\p^2}{\p y^2}+\frac{\p^2}{\p z^2}$
in $T$.
The function $w$ satisfies conditions: $w >0$ in $T$
and $w=0$ on $\p T$.

Let $\Pi$ be unlimited cylinder in the space $\R^4$
which a cross-section with hyperplane is a
quadrangular pyramid with edges of unit length (one-half of the octahedron). Let $L$ be a second
order linear differential operator in divergence form which uniformly elliptic with bounded
measurable coefficients and $\eta$ is its ellipticity constant. Let $u$ be a solution of he mixed boundary
value problem in $\Pi$ for the equation $Lu=0$ ($u>0$) with homogeneous Dirichlet and Neumann data
on the boundary of the cylinder. Our theorem allows us to continue this solution from the
cylinder $\Pi$ to the whole space $\R^4$ with the same ellipticity constant $\eta$.

This continuation allows us to prove a number of theorems about growth of the solution u in
the cylinder $\Pi$.

The idea of using barycentric coordinates is taken from paper of A.P.\,Brodnikov, where it is
used for the finding of eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in the triangle.
Eigenfunction of the Laplace operator in hypertetrahedron from $\R^4$ and in $n+1$-dimensional
simplex from $\R^n$ ($n\ge 2$) were constructed by the author.

We consider the Vlasov system of equations describing the evolution

$\R_+^3\times\R^3$ with initial conditions for distribution
functions $f^\beta\big|_{t=0}=f_0^\beta(x,p)$, $\beta=\pm1$, and the
Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions for the potential of an

distribution function (for positively charged ions if $\beta=+1$ and
for electrons if $\beta=-1$) at the point~$x$ with impulse~$p$,
$\R_+^3=\{x\in\R^3\colon x_1>0\}$. Assume that initial distribution
functions are sufficiently smooth and ${\rm supp}
f_0^\beta\subset(\R_\delta^3 \cap B_\lambda(0))\times B_\rho(0)$,

%% Abstract in English:
Let $\mathcal{O} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a bounded domain of class $C^{1,1}$.
In $L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)$, we consider a matrix elliptic differential
operator $A_{\varepsilon}= b(\mathbf{D})^* g(\mathbf{x}/\varepsilon) b(\mathbf{D})$
with the Dirichlet boundary condition. We assume that
an $(m\times m)$-matrix-valued function $g(\mathbf{x})$
is bounded, uniformly positive definite and periodic
with respect to some lattice $\Gamma$. The elementary cell of $\Gamma$ is denoted by $\Omega$.
Next, $b(\mathbf{D})=\sum_{j=1}^d b_j D_j$ is an $(m\times n)$-matrix first
order differential operator ($b_j$ are constant
matrices). It is assumed that $m \ge n$ and the symbol $b(\boldsymbol{\xi})= \sum_{j=1}^d b_j \xi_j$
has maximal rank, i.~e., $\text{rank}\,b(\boldsymbol{\xi})= n$ for $0 \ne \boldsymbol{\xi} \in
\mathbb{R}^d$. The simplest example is $A_{\varepsilon} = -\text{div}\,g(\mathbf{x}/\varepsilon)\nabla$.

We study the behavior of the solution $\mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ of the Dirichlet problem
$A_{\varepsilon}\mathbf{u}_\varepsilon = \mathbf{F}$ in $\mathcal{O}$,
$\mathbf{u}_\varepsilon\vert_{\partial \mathcal{O}} =0$,
where $\mathbf{F} \in L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)$.
It turns out that $\mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ converges in $L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)$
to $\mathbf{u}_0$, as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Here $\mathbf{u}_0$ is the solution of the "homogenized"\
Dirichlet problem $A^0 \mathbf{u}_0=\mathbf{F}$ in $\mathcal{O}$,
$\mathbf{u}_0\vert_{\partial \mathcal{O}} =0$. The \textit{effective operator}
$A^0$ is given by the expression $A^0 = b(\mathbf{D})^* g^0 b(\mathbf{D})$
with the Dirichlet boundary condition. The effective matrix $g^0$ is a constant positive $(m\times m)$-matrix
defined as follows. Denote by $\Lambda(\mathbf{x})$ the $(n \times m)$-matrix-valued
periodic solution of the equation
$b(\mathbf{D})^* g(\mathbf{x}) (b(\mathbf{D})\Lambda(\mathbf{x}) + \mathbf{1}_m) =0$
such that $\int_\Omega \Lambda(\mathbf{x})\, d\mathbf{x} =0$.
Then $g^0 = |\Omega|^{-1} \int_\Omega g(\mathbf{x}) (b(\mathbf{D})\Lambda(\mathbf{x})
+ \mathbf{1}_m)\,d\mathbf{x}$.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Theorem 1.} (see [2]) \textit{We have the following sharp order
error estimate}:
$$
\| \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon - \mathbf{u}_0 \|_{L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)}
\le C \varepsilon \| \mathbf{F}\|_{L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)}.
$$


Now we give approximation of $\mathbf{u}_\varepsilon$ in the Sobolev space
$H^1(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)$. For this, the first order corrector must be taken into account.

\smallskip
\noindent\textbf{Theorem 2.} (see [1]) 1) \textit{Let $\Lambda \in L_\infty$, and denote
$\Lambda^\varepsilon(\mathbf{x}) = \Lambda(\varepsilon^{-1} \mathbf{x})$. Then}
$$
\| \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon - \mathbf{u}_0 - \varepsilon \Lambda^\varepsilon b(\mathbf{D})
\mathbf{u}_0 \|_{H^1(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)}
\le C \varepsilon^{1/2} \| \mathbf{F}\|_{L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)}.
$$

\noindent 2) \textit{In the general case, we have}
$$
\| \mathbf{u}_\varepsilon - \mathbf{u}_0 - \varepsilon \Lambda^\varepsilon b(\mathbf{D})
(S_\varepsilon \widetilde{\mathbf{u}}_0) \|_{H^1(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)}
\le C \varepsilon^{1/2} \| \mathbf{F}\|_{L_2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n)}.
$$
\textit{Here $\widetilde{\mathbf{u}}_0 = P_{\mathcal{O}} \mathbf{u}_0$ and
$P_{\mathcal{O}}: H^2(\mathcal{O};\mathbb{C}^n) \to H^2(\mathbb{R}^d;\mathbb{C}^n)$
is a continuous extension operator, $S_\varepsilon$ is the smoothing operator
$(S_\varepsilon \mathbf{u})(\mathbf{x}) = |\Omega|^{-1} \int_\Omega
\mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x} - \varepsilon \mathbf{z})\,d\mathbf{z}$.}

%\smallskip
%We use the results of M.~Birman and T.~Suslina for homogenization problem in $\mathbb{R}^d$:
%the analogs of estimates (2), (3) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are of sharp order $\varepsilon$.
%The problem is reduced to estimating of the discrepancy $\mathbf{w}_\varepsilon$,
%which is the solution of the problem $A_\varepsilon \mathbf{w}_\varepsilon =0$ in $\mathcal{O}$,
%$\mathbf{w}_\varepsilon\vert_{\partial \mathcal{O}} =
%\varepsilon \Lambda^\varepsilon b(\mathbf{D})
%(S_\varepsilon \widetilde{\mathbf{u}}_0)\vert_{\partial \mathcal{O}}$
%(or $\mathbf{w}_\varepsilon\vert_{\partial \mathcal{O}} =
%\varepsilon \Lambda^\varepsilon b(\mathbf{D}){\mathbf{u}}_0\vert_{\partial \mathcal{O}}$
%in the case $\Lambda \in L_\infty$).
%We show that the norm of $\mathbf{w}_\varepsilon$ in $H^1$ satisfies estimate
%of order $\varepsilon^{1/2}$. This leads to (2), (3).
%At the same time, the norm of $\mathbf{w}_\varepsilon$ in $L_2$ is of order $\varepsilon$,
%this allows us to prove sharp order estimate (1).

%% Abstract in English:

In a singular perturbation problem one is concerned with a differential equation of the form
$A (\varepsilon) u_\varepsilon = f_\varepsilon$
with initial or boundary conditions
$B (\varepsilon) u_\varepsilon = g_\varepsilon$,
where $\varepsilon$ is a small parameter.
The distinguishing feature of this problem is that the orders of
$A (\varepsilon)$ and
$B (\varepsilon)$
for $\varepsilon \neq 0$ are higher than the orders of $A (0)$ and
$B (0)$,
respectively.
%The differential problem in question is referred to as
%   a perturbed problem when $\varepsilon \neq 0$ and
%   a degenerate problem when $\varepsilon = 0$.
%The singular perturbation problem consists of studying the behaviour of %solutions or eigenvalues as $\varepsilon \to 0$.
%Such problems can also be considered with more than one parameter.
%
%Singular perturbation problems arise frequently in applied mathematics and have %been considered at least as far back in history as Lord Rayleigh's treatise
%\cite{Rayl45}, first published in 1877.
%Rayleigh considered the effect of a small amount of stiffness on the models of %vibration of a violin string.
%A discussion of the role of singular perturbation phenomena in mathematical %physics can be found in \cite{Frie55}.
%
%Some difficulties are inherent in singular perturbation problems.
%Solutions of the degenerate problem will not in general be as smooth as %solutions of the perturbed problem.
%Moreover, solutions of the degenerate problem usually will not satisfy as many %initial or boundary conditions as do solutions of the perturbed problem.
%Hence, if solutions of the perturbed problem are to converge to solutions of the %degenerate problem, the notion of convergence will probably have to be rather %weak.
%Due to the ``loss'' of initial or boundary data it may also happen that %solutions of the perturbed problem converge in a stronger sense in the interior %of the underlying domain, than in the vicinity of the boundary.
%This is known as the boundary layer phenomenon.
There is by now a vast amount of literature on singular perturbation
%problems for ordinary differential equations, both linear and non-linear.
%An extensive bibliography of this literature is contained in \cite{Waso66}.
%
%There is also a considerable amount of literature on singular perturbation
problems for partial differential equations.
A comprehensive theory of such problems was initiated by the remarkable paper of
Vishik and Lyusternik \cite{VishLyus57}.
%They obtained asymptotic expressions for solutions of the perturbed problem for %linear equations using boundary layer techniques.
%In this paper the main condition on the dependence of $A (\varepsilon)$ on a %small parameter was formulated and the asymptotics as $\varepsilon \to 0$ of the %solution of the Dirichlet problem was constructed.
%\cite{VishLyus57} also contains a sizable bibliography.
%
%In \cite{Huet60}, Huet published several theorems on convergence in singular %perturbation problems for linear elliptic and parabolic partial differential %equations.
%One particular feature distinguishes this paper from those previously mentioned.
%This is that convergence theorems are first proven in a Hilbert space setting %and then applied to the differential problems as opposed to starting directly %with the differential equations.
%In the elliptic vase, theorems on local convergence and convergence of %tangential derivatives at the boundary are also proven.
%The work \cite{Huet60} is fundamental to the considerations in \cite{Gree68} %aimed at obtaining rate of convergence estimates for solutions of singular %perturbations of linear elliptic boundary value problems.
%The problem can be described as follows.
%Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a compact smooth manifold and let $\varepsilon$ be a %positive real parameter.
%Consider two elliptic boundary value problems on $\mathcal{X}$,
%   $(\varepsilon \mathcal{A}_1) + \mathcal{A}_0) u_\varepsilon = f$ and
%   $\mathcal{A}_0 u = f$,
%where the order of $\mathcal{A}_1$ is greater than the order of $\mathcal{A}_0$.
%The problem is to determine in what sense $u_\varepsilon$ converges to $u$ on
%$\mathcal{X}$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$ and to estimate the rate of convergence.
%
%Pseudodifferential problems with small parameter were studied in the 1970s by
%G.~Eskin and A.~Demidov.
%For boundary value problems of general type the theory of singular perturbations %was developed in the 1980s by Frank, see \cite{Fran90}.
In \cite{Vole06}, Volevich completed the theory of differential boundary value problems with small parameter by formulating the Shapiro-Lopatinskii type ellipticity condition% and proving that it is equivalent to a priori estimates uniform in the parameter%
.

We contribute to the theory by constructing an algebra of pseudodifferential operators in which singularly perturbed boundary value problems can be treated.
Given any $m, \mu \in \R$, denote by
$\mathcal{S}^{m,\mu}$
the space of all smooth functions $a (x,\xi,\varepsilon)$ on
$T^\ast \R^n \times \R_{\geq 0}$,
such that
$
|D^\alpha_x D^\beta_\xi a|
\leq
C_{\alpha,\beta}\, <\xi>^{\mu-|\beta|} <\varepsilon \xi>^{m-\mu}
$
for all multi-indices $\alpha$ and $\beta$, where
$C_{\alpha,\beta}$ are constants independent of $x$, $\xi$ and $\varepsilon$.
For any fixed $\varepsilon > 0$, a function $a \in \mathcal{S}^{m,\mu}$ is a symbol of order $m$ on $\R^n$ which obviously degenerates as $\varepsilon \to 0$.
These symbols quantize to continuous operators
$H^{r,s} \to H^{r-m,s-\mu}$
in a scale of Sobolev spaces on $\R^n$ whose norms depend on $\varepsilon$ and are based on $L^2$ and weight functions
$<\xi>^{s} <\varepsilon \xi>^{r-s}$.
The family $\mathcal{S}^{m-j,\mu-j}$ with $j = 0, 1, \ldots$ is used as usual to define asymptotic sums of homogeneous symbols.
By the homogeneity of degree $\mu$ is meant the property
$
a (x, \lambda \xi, \lambda^{-1} \varepsilon)
= \lambda^\mu a (x, \xi, \varepsilon)
$
for all $\lambda > 0$.
Let $\mathcal{S}^{m,\mu}_{\mathrm{phg}}$ stand for the subspace of
$\mathcal{S}^{m,\mu}$
consisting of all polyhomogeneous symbols, i.e., those admitting asymptotic expansions in homogeneous symbols.
For any $a \in \mathcal{S}^{m,\mu}_{\mathrm{phg}}$ there is well-defined principal homogeneous symbol $\sigma^\mu (a)$ of degree $\mu$ whose invertibility away from the zero section of $T^\ast \R^n$ is said to be the interior ellipticity with small parameter.
%
Familiar techniques lead now to calculi of pseudodifferential operators with small parameter on diverse compactifications of smooth manifolds.
Our results gain in interest if we realize that pseudodifferential operators with small parameter provide also adequate tools for studying Cauchy problems for elliptic equations.

This is a joint paper with my PhD student Evgeniya Dyachenko who studies singular perturbation problems.

%% Abstract in English:
The three-dimensional inviscid Hasegawa-Mima model is one of the fundamental models that describe plasma turbulence. The model also appears as a simplified reduced Rayleigh-B\'enard convection model. The mathematical analysis of the Hasegawa-Mima equation is challenging  due to the absence of any smoothing viscous terms, as well as to the presence of an analogue of the vortex stretching terms. In this talk, we introduce and study a model which is inspired by the inviscid Hasegawa-Mima model, which we call a pseudo-Hasegawa-Mima model. The introduced model is easier to investigate analytically than the original inviscid Hasegawa-Mima model, as it has a nicer mathematical structure. The resemblance between this model and the Euler equations of inviscid incompressible fluids inspired us to adapt the techniques and ideas introduced for the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional Euler equations to prove the global existence and uniqueness of solutions for our model. This is in addition to proving and implementing a new technical logarithmic inequality, generalizing the Brezis-Gallouet and the Berzis-Wainger inequalities. Moreover, we prove the continuous dependence on initial data of solutions for the pseudo-Hasegawa-Mima model. These are the first results on existence and uniqueness of solutions for a model that is related to the three-dimensional inviscid Hasegawa-Mima equations.

%% Abstract in English:
Interior transmission eigenvalues are defined by the problem

\begin{equation*}
-\Delta u - \lambda u =0, \quad x \in \mathcal O, \quad u\in H^2(\mathcal O),
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
-\nabla A \nabla v - \lambda   n(x)v =0, \quad x \in \mathcal O, \quad v\in H^2(\mathcal O),
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
\begin{array}{l}
u-v=0, \quad x \in \partial \mathcal O, \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu_A}=0, \quad x \in \partial \mathcal O,
\end{array}
\end{equation*}
were $\mathcal O\subset R^d$ is a bounded domain with a smooth boundary, $H^{2}(\mathcal O), ~H^{s}(\partial \mathcal O)$ are Sobolev spaces, $A(x),~x\in \overline{\mathcal O}$, is a smooth symmetric elliptic ($A=A^t>0$) matrix with real valued entries, $n(x)$ is   a smooth function, $\nu$ is the outward unit normal vector and the co-normal derivative is defined as follows
$$
\frac{\partial } {\partial \nu_A}v =\nu \cdot A \nabla v.
$$

The importance of these eigenvalues is based on their relation to the scattering of plane waves by inhomoginuety defined by $A$ and $n$: a real $\lambda=k^2$ is an interior transmission eigenvalue if and only if the far-field operator has a non trivial kernel at the frequency $k$.

The problem above is not symmetric. However we will show that under some conditions it has infinitely many real eigenvalues. We will obtain the Weyl type bound from below for the counting function of these eigenvelues as well as some estimates on the first egenvalues.

These results are obtained together with E.\,Lakshtanov.

This paper considers   a boundary-value problem for a nonlinear
system of equations that are derived from  a trading
process model \cite{VSB}.
\smallskip


Let $u(x.t),v(x,t)$,\ $0<x<1$,\ $t>0$, satisfy a system
\begin{equation}\label{vv-1}
\begin{array}{cclc}
\displaystyle{\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t
}}&=&-a_u\displaystyle{\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial
x}}&-b_uu(x,t)-c\min[u(x,t), v(x,t)],
\\&&\\
\displaystyle{\frac{\partial v(x,t)}{\partial t }}&=&\ \ \
a_v\displaystyle{\frac{\partial v(x,t)}{\partial
x}}&-b_vv(x,t)-c\min[u(x,t), v(x,t)],
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{vv-2}
\frac{\partial u(0,t)}{\partial t
}=d_u-a_uu(0,t)-b_uu(0,t)-c\min[u(0,t),v(0,t)],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{vv-3}
\frac{\partial v(1,t)}{\partial t
}=d_v-a_vv(1,t)-b_vv(1,t)-c\min[u(1,t),v(1,t)],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{vv-4}
u(x,0)=u_0(x)\geq 0,\ \ v(x,0)=v_0(x)\geq 0.
\end{equation}

Here $a_{u/v},\ b_{u/v},\ c,\ d_{u/v}$ are positive.



\begin{theorem}\label{vv-thm1}
For any  initial data $u_0(x),v_0(x)$  for all $t>0$ there exists a
unique  solution  to (\rm{\ref{vv-1}})-(\rm{\ref{vv-4}}). \ \  As
$t\to\infty$ a solution approaches a fixed point which is the unique
solution to  a  system



\begin{equation}\label{vv-5}
\begin{array}{cl}
-a_u\displaystyle{\frac{{\rm d} u(x,t)}{{\rm d}
x}}&-b_uu(x,t)-c\min[u(x,t), v(x,t)]=0,
\\
a_v\displaystyle{\frac{{\rm d}v(x,t)}{{\rm d}
x}}&-b_vv(x,t)-c\min[u(x,t), v(x,t)]=0,
\end{array}

\begin{equation}\label{vv-6}
d_u-a_uu(0,t)-b_uu(0,t)-c\min[u(0,t),v(0,t)]=0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{vv-7}
d_v-a_vv(1,t)-b_vv(1,t)-c\min[u(1,t),v(1,t)]=0.
\end{equation}
\end{theorem}

Remark that the type of boundary conditions  (\ref{vv-2}), (\ref{vv-3})
and (\ref{vv-6}), (\ref{vv-7}) depends on  sign of $u-v$, that makes not
evident the uniqueness of solution to (\ref{vv-5})-(\ref{vv-7}).

%% Abstract in English:

This is a lecture on joint work with H.~Harbrecht (U. Basel,
Switzerland), G.~Of (TU. Graz, Austria) and
N.~Zorii (Nat. Academy Sci. Kiev, Ukraine).

In $\mathbb R^n$, $n\geqslant 2$, we study the constructive and
numerical solution of minimizing the energy relative to the Riesz
kernel $|{\bf x}-{\bf y}|^{\alpha-n}$, where $1<\alpha<n$, for the
Gauss variational problem, considered for finitely many compact,
mutually disjoint, boundaryless $(n-1)$--dimensional
Lipschitz manifolds $\Gamma_\ell$, $\ell\in L$, each $\Gamma_\ell$
being charged with Borel measures with the sign $\alpha_\ell=\pm1$
prescribed. We show that the Gauss variational problem over an
affine cone of Borel measures can alternatively be formulated as a
minimum problem over an affine cone of surface distributions
belonging to the Sobolev--Slobodetski space
$H^{-{\varepsilon}/{2}}(\Gamma)$, where $\varepsilon:=\alpha-1$ and
$\Gamma:=\bigcup_{\ell\in L}\,\Gamma_\ell$. This allows the
application of simple layer boundary integral operators on~$\Gamma$
and, hence, a penalty approximation. A corresponding numerical
method is based on the Galerkin--Bubnov discretization with
piecewise constant boundary elements. For $n=3$ and  $\alpha=2$, multipole
approximation and in the case  $1<\alpha<3=n$  wavelet matrix compression is
applied to sparsify the system matrix.  Numerical results are
presented to illustrate the approach.

%% Abstract in English:
In a series of papers in 1969/70, Vishik and Grushin \cite{VG69, VG70}
introduced a class of degenerate pseudodifferential operators roughly
being of the form
\[
|x|^{b-(l_\ast+1)m} P(x,y,|x|D_x,|x|^{l_\ast+1}D_y),
\]
where $m$ is the order of the operator and $b\in{\mathbb R}$ is a
parameter ($b=m l_\ast$ in the work of Vishik and Grushin). Here,
$l_\ast\in {\mathbb Q}$, $l_\ast>0$, $x\in{\mathbb R}^q$, $y\in
{\mathbb R}^d$, and $P(x,y,\xi,\eta)$ is a pseudodifferential
symbol. A basic example is the Tricomi operator $\partial_x^2 + x
\Delta_y$, where $l_\ast=1/2$, $q=1$, $m=2$, and $b=1$.

In this talk, we develop a pseudodifferential calculus for such
operators including a full symbol calculus, discuss elliptic boundary
problems \cite{W03} and the hyperbolic Cauchy problem \cite{DW02} in
this class, and eventually present applications to 2D mixed
elliptic-hyperbolic equations (where $q=d=1$) with variable
coefficients. In the latter case, the problem is reduced to a
cone-degenerate elliptic problem in the interface (which is an
interval), where the equations under study change type.

%% Abstract in English:

We consider coagulation process of water drops which 
fall in the air. 
This process is described by an integro-differential 
equation for the density $\sigma (m,t,x)$ of the water 
liquid contained in drops of mass $m$. 
For the motion of drops we consider the their velocity 
$u(m)$ determined by the mass $m$ and the velocity of the 
air; on the other hand for the coagulation process we 
consider a probability $\beta(m_1, m_2)$ of meeting 
between a drop of mass $m_1$ and one of mass $m_2$ 
(see for example \cite{[V84]}). 

First we prove the existence of a stationay solution 
with a constant horizontal wind \cite{[MBAH]}. 
Secondly we prove the existence and uniqueness of the 
global solution in the absence of the wind \cite{[BAH]}; 
the convergence of the global solution to the stationary 
solution is a corollary of this result.

$u_0\in L^\infty(\mathbb R^2)$ is allowed and no assumptions on the spatial decay of solutions as $|x|\to\infty$ are
posed.
\par
In addition, the applications to the classical Navier--Stokes
problem in $\mathbb R^2$ (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$) will be also considered. In particular, the improved estimate on the possible growth rate of spatially non-decaying solutions as time goes to infinity:
$$
\|u(t)\|_{L^2_b(\R^2)}\le C(t^5+1),
$$ 
where $C$ depends on $u_0$ and $g$, but is independent of $t$, will be presented. Note that the previous best known estimate was super-exponential in time:
$$
\|u(t)\|_{L^\infty(\R^2)}\le C_1e^{C_2 t^2},
$$
