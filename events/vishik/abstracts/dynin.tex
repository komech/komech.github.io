%% Abstract in English:
The second quantization of a complexified Gelfand triple produces   the   Kree nuclear triple of sesqui-holomorphic functionals on it. Any continuous operator in the Kree triple  is a  pseudovariational operator, a strong limit of second quantized   pseudodifferential operators on  $\mathbb{R}^n,\ n\rightarrow \infty$. 


A thorough  analysis of the Noether Yang-Mills energy functional of Cauchy data shows that it is  the anti-normal symbol of a selfadjoint elliptic operator in variational  derivatives. Such quantum Yang-Mills energy operator  has  a mass  gap at the bottom of its  spectrum. This is a solution of the Yang-Mills Millennium problem.

\medskip
\emph{Key words}: Second quantizations; infinite-dimensional pseudodifferential operators,  symbolic calculus;  infinite-dimensional ellipticity; essentially hyperbolic non-linear partial differential  equations; Yang-Mills Millennium problem.
